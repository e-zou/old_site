# Inspiration
Before I started this project, I was afraid of coding things. As someone who started CS in college, I felt insignificant compared to my classmates, who always seemed to have more experience and talent than me. Although I attempted to build my own app or Chrome extension, I never seemed to get anywhere. It was just plain frustrating because I was trying so hard. I was looking at videos, reading tutorials, attending class, but the results just seemed to tell me that I was dumb. 

Lucky for me, I'm an optimist at heart, and I was adamant to find another way to learn. During my 2018 summer, I took a deep dive into front-end web development through my internship with HackCville and Astraea. I got to learn HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Wordpress, UI/UX, and so much more. Equipped with the new knowledge of Jekyll, a static-site building engine, and a surge of confidence, I finally started to build my very own website, which I dreamed of doing since I started as a CS student.

# How I Built it
The specific toolset I used for this website are: HTML, SASS, GitHub, and Jekyll, which included YAML front matter. Throughout the year, I used GitHub to store my code and host the website, Figma to build wireframes, and asked friends to give me critques. 

Overall, this is a static website and does not have any back-end components. I choose this route, because it was simple to build, flexible to change, and I would not have to spend money for back-end hosting. My goal was to practice with the foundations of website-making. That's why I used my own custom CSS as opposed to using frameworks such as Bootstrap and Google Material UI. 

The project roughly took me the whole year- not because I didn't know how to code but rather because designing became very time-consuming. I wanted to make everything look perfect, which kept me revising the designs. I went through at least four drastically different drafts for this project because none of them fully represented who I am and who I wanted to be. The funny part is that in the end, I still have so many things that I wanted to change. 

The process in which I built the website followed the basic UI/UX wheel. It went from ideation and free-styling many designs to narrowing down something that I liked. From there, I went into the analysis phase in which I put into consideration the reasons I wanted to build the website: to act as an online portfolio for employers and share some personal facts about myself. After that was the implemenation phase. I coded the subjectively-judged best high-fidelity wireframe, starting from the boiler-plate essentials to adding default styles and text to custom descriptions and images. I also got feedback from friends and evaluated my designs, too. Of course, the phases are very fluid, and most of the time, I was in a constant loop of adding a section and asking myself "Does it look good? Does it fit my purpose?"

# Lessons Learned
The biggest lessons I got out of the project were: it's really fun starting from scratch, good code takes time, and learn from others before you. Like turning a blank sheet of paper into a beautiful narrative in writing, I found great joy from transforming an empty screen into many lines of code. And because I was not building this for a grade, the project became a source of relaxation.
