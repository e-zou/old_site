# The assignment. 
As part of training for HackCville, I was randomly assigned to a group of four developers. We were to tackle the task of building an online talent-matching platform for a mock company, RevTek, so that companies can be matched with talented students. We had two mock meetings with the CEO of the company, and two weeks to build it.

# Company Research
During our scheduled interview, our team delved into RevTek's core missions and values along with the hard requirements. Driven their mission to give every student a fair chance, we ideated features that can differentiate our product from competitors of hiring platforms such as LinkedIn and Handshake. What makes RevTek unique, is the ability to showcase budding talent and its program to provide training to meet industry internship standards.

Most importantly, we had to build out these required features: a contract submissions system, commenting system, profile views, and user roles differentiation.

# User Research
Given our limited time (2-3 hours a day dedicated to this project), our team chose to draw from our own internship experiences and ask a couple more people to get a sense of the full user story. 

Our key insights were that: we liked seeing systems that our friends use, we wanted features to validate input when we type in the wrong thing, and be able to interact with companies on a personal level. From here, we started mocking up our system.

# Mock Ups
Starting with paper wireframes, we drew the different views for the different roles. For example, the admin would have access to approving contracts and deleting people from the database if there were ever any problems. On the other hand, students can view and change their profile. They can also comment and view posts in the marketplace, where the contracts from companies were displayed.

# Building it Out
Using GitHub to collaborate, Google Material UI for design, Firebase for the backend, and React for the front-end, we created a web interface that companies, students, and admins could use to facilitate the job-hunting process.

# Lessons Learned
This project is still incomplete in terms of uploading personalized photos and having input validation in a lot of the contract submission fields. However, it was a great learning experience for working with others and learning how React components worked.
