<h1 id="the-assignment">The assignment.</h1>
<p>My Human-Computer-Interaction professor randomly assigned us groups to work with. We were to complete a semester-long project on any topic we wished to problem-solve. Our group, made up of 5 students chose to find a solution to bring electricity to third world countries through solar power. I was the primary UI/UX lead.</p>

<h1 id="concept-statement">Concept Statement.</h1>
<p>There has been focused attention in recent years on the development of renewable energy systems, especially regions with limited access to energy infrastructure. Solar energy solutions are particularly viable due to their portability and scalability as well as their high efficiency and usability.</p>

<p>Our group seeks to flatten the process by which entrepreneurs and employees of NGOs and other energy consultants can create solar infrastructure with a website that provides necessary information for leaders in local communities. Our site will be centered around a price estimator and recommendations tool.</p>

<h1 id="contextual-inquiry--analysis">Contextual Inquiry &amp; Analysis</h1>

<p>We prepared multiple interviews with people who worked in the solar power industry, so that we could understand the context for our solution.  We scheduled interviews with three sources: Taylor Brown, the CTO at SunTribe Solar (a prominent solar development startup in Charlottesville), Dr. Kyusang Lee, a researcher at U.Va whose “research interests highlight the use of organic and inorganic materials in optoelectronic devices, with a particular emphasis on applications for solar energy conversion and imaging,” and Chris, the branch manager at Charlottesville’s Altenergy location.</p>

<p>We learned about the process of how solar organizations work to install solar panels for clients. We traced the step by step process of how solar panels are handled by delivery companies, site engineers, solar panel engineers and solar panel parts companies. In addition, we learned about the growing demand for renewable energy, not just in Virginia, but worldwide. Furthermore, we learned about solar panels optimization and confirmed the ease of solar panel installation. Our insights allowed us to narrow the scope of our project so that we encourage the communications between the NGOs and the cities that need the power instead of encouraging people to install solar panel parts by themselves.</p>

<p>Overall, there seems to not be a a one-stop place for all the organizations and companies involved with installing solar panels for developing countries. In addition, there is a great demand and available land for solar energy in the developing countries.</p>

<h1 id="user-flow--requirements-extraction">User Flow &amp; Requirements Extraction</h1>
<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/requirements.png" alt="photo" class="post-picture" /></p>

<p>From our interviews, our team made a chart to extract requirements for our system. It not only displays the priorities, but also the specific interviewee and interviewer with the section number the insights came from.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/wad.jpg" alt="photo" class="post-picture" /></p>

<p>After synthesizing what we learned from our initial research along with our interviews, we arranged a free-flowing work activites diagram with all the different user’s needs and system requirements. We used sticky notes so that all of us could collaborate and categorize the specifications in an organized manner.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/userflow.png" alt="photo" class="post-picture" /></p>

<p>We also made a user flow model and a few other models to communicate our ideas across of what we are trying to do and how we are trying to bridge the gap between providing solar power and getting solar power.</p>

<h1 id="user-personas--mock-ups">User Personas &amp; Mock Ups</h1>
<p>Using paper wireframes and Balsalmiq, our team made rapid prototypes for our client to and professor for feedback. We wanted our mental model of the system to align with the users’ mental models as close as possible.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/wireframe.png" alt="photo" class="post-picture" /></p>

<h1 id="end-result">End Result</h1>
<p>Through an iterative process of ideation, analysis, implementation, and evaluation, our team utimately made a website addressing the issue of accessibility to electricity. If you want to see the full project, visit <a href="https://wicshacks.wixsite.com/hacktothefuture/sponsors">here</a> is the link.</p>

<p>Admittedly, our solution is not the best and probably would not be feasible in the real world because of time constraints on through research and funding constraints to travel the world and evaluate with real users in the third-world countries.</p>

<p>Still, our team learned a lot about documentation, communication, and the neccessity of empathy.</p>
