# My Personal Website
Welcome to my personal website, which is built using Jekyll. I plan to update the website occasionally to write about thoughts and progress of my learning journey that a resume or GitHub won't be able to fit. In this repo, you will find all the required code to make my website. Head over to my website at [e-zou.github.io](http://e-zou.github.io).
