<h3 id="our-story">Our Story</h3>
<hr />

<h1 id="how-it-all-began">How it All Began</h1>
<p>The Women in Computing Sciences Club at UVA created a new role, Hackathon-chair, two years before Gabby DeFilippo, my awesome co-chair, and I were elected into the position. Our responsibilities were to coordinate transportation and promotion of external hackathons and create our own annual spring hackathon. We decided on hosting a half-day hackathon from 8am to 6pm for approximately 50 attendees.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-hackathon">What is a Hackathon?</h1>
<p>Typical hackathons, which lasts one or two days, is largely a competition for coding projects with many side opportunties to enjoy new experiences and enhance programming skills. Almost every hackathon have workshops, guest speakers, tech company meet-and-greets, industry professional mentors, and most importantly, amazing food and swag.</p>

<h1 id="struggles">Struggles</h1>
<p>From the start, we had a lot of logistics to figure out. The previous chair left us with no templates and few guidelines to work with, so we had to create almost everything such as financial spreadsheets, company sponsorsheets, and volunteer forms from scratch. In addition, our positions were still so new that we didn’t have a set budget carved out for us. This meant we had little to no guaranteed funding from our own club. Futhermore, we could not track down previous volunteers that had been part of the previous hackathon committees, so we had to learn how to build a team, too. The hardest part was recruiting people and then retaining them.</p>

<h3 id="overcoming-struggles">Overcoming Struggles</h3>
<hr />

<h1 id="co-directing">Co-directing</h1>
<p>One key part of co-directing was transparency and communication skills. Gabby and I started a Slack channel from the get-go and spoke frequently to each other about updates and plans. There was rarely a moment in which one or the other didn’t know what was going on.</p>

<h1 id="setting-rules--guidelines">Setting Rules &amp; Guidelines</h1>
<p>Although our hackathon committee was formed only four months before our event date, Gabby and I prepared a lot of resources and set up an effective organizational structure. We divided the roles into sizeable chunks for each team (Marketing, Fundraising, Speakers &amp; Workshops, Food, and Logistics) to fulfill. We also created our own own budget sheet and professional emails templates.</p>

<h1 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h1>
<p>When it came to recruiting our team, we accepted everyone who showed interest as part of our initiative to give women more opportunities. We didn’t want to limit students, who had their own busy lives with homeworks and exams, with the excise task of filling another long-winded application. However, the same recruiting tactic also made it very hard to know which members would stay dedicated to the project because we had no measurement for the amount of interest.</p>

<h1 id="team-building">Team-building</h1>
<p>Despite all this, Gabby and I worked to create a cohesive group environment by structuring meetings so that each team would have individual time to work on tasks. In addition, we made examples out of teams and individuals who had done exceptional work to encourage and inspire others. Most importantly, we made sure that every member got comfortable with communicating and reporting their progress.</p>

<h1 id="funding">Funding</h1>
<p>As for funding, we did a combination of cold-emailing companies, connecting with alumns, and asking companies our committee members personally worked with before. In addition, we reached out to school organizations that support student initiatives. Out of the approximately 50 sponsors we contacted, we eventually secured the interest of 11. The process was especially difficult as many sponsors did not have available funds to support us because we started asking so late in the year. Lesson learned.</p>

<h1 id="looking-foward">Looking Foward</h1>
<p>Overall, it was a worthwhile learning experience, and we were able to deliver what we had promised. Looking back, there is so much room for improvements, but they were not things we would have known to improve if we didn’t just go out there and try it. For example, we should have started recruiting and sponsorship searching earlier in the year. In addition, I wish there was time to do more events such as linkedin portrait shots during the event.</p>
